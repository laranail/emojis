/**
 * Runs deptrac and fails on anything that would leave the architecture boundary unenforced.
 *
 * **deptrac does not exit non-zero when it cannot parse a file.** It prints "Syntax Error on File
 * …", then reports "Violations 0 / Errors 0" and exits 0 — so a file it cannot read is a file with
 * no rules applied, and the build goes green. `laranail/chrono` hit exactly this (copied from `laranail/atlas`): deptrac 3.0.0
 * could not parse PHP 8.5's `clone ($this, [...])`, and its `src/Core` was unguarded for as long as
 * that went unnoticed.
 *
 * Both packages pin deptrac ^4.7, which parses current syntax. This guard exists because the pin
 * fixes today's instance and not the class: the next language feature deptrac lags on would fail
 * the same silent way.
 *
 * Fails when: deptrac exits non-zero · any violation is reported · any error is reported ·
 * the output mentions a syntax error · the JSON report cannot be read at all.
